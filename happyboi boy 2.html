    <h2> A big coding inspiration</h2>
    <p><u>A thank you to Fraser Hack club</u></p>
    <p> Thank you to all my friends out in Fraser Hack in Coquitlam BC for involving me within meetings for coding and building websites.
        It has been a great experience so far and I truely look forward to everything there is to learn within the next months, and so 
        forward. A special thank you to Paya Maroufi, for encouraging me to building my k nowledge on the aspect. I had not been very consious
        of the idea on the topic before hand. Hopefully throughout the next year and onwards, further opportunities on tech shall open and new hackclub
    events shall be held. I look forward to it!!
